# 🚚 SQL Drop-Off Analytics – End-to-End Database Project

This project designs and implements a fully normalized relational database for a delivery/drop-off system. It includes schema creation, data loading, business logic, optimization, and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build a robust, scalable database system that manages:
- Delivery operations
- Users and drivers
- Payments, billing, and insurance
- Data validation and reporting via procedures, views, triggers, and functions

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ Normalized to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**
- ✅ Business logic handled via **stored procedures** and **triggers**
- ✅ Views for **query abstraction** and usability
- ✅ User-defined **functions** for reusability
- ✅ Performance-optimized with **indexes**
- ✅ Constraints to enforce **referential integrity**

## 🧾 Reflections

This project gave me hands-on experience in designing a working SQL system from scratch. I encountered real-world debugging scenarios and learned the critical importance of schema planning, testing triggers, and writing modular SQL code.

## 📌 Notes

- This system is **fully academic**; all data is fictitious
- The database design supports easy extension to frontend applications
- SQL scripts are designed to run sequentially
